                        <p>The University of Edinburgh, founded in 1582, is the sixth oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Scotland's ancient universities. The University of Edinburgh is ranked 20th in the world by the 2020 QS World University Rankings. It has around 300 student exchange partners in nearly 40 countries world-wide.
                        <br><br>I took four courses at the university and learned quite a lot. Taking classes in Scotland was very different than my educational experience at Bucknell. The University of Edinburgh has roughly thirty-three thousand students, a little more than Bucknell! The university was also located in the city, which I really liked compared to the fields of corn at Bucknell. Not only was the university itself different, but they way courses are run are different in Scotland. On the first day of classes, I would walk into a lecture hall with two-hundred students. As classes continued, the numbers dwindled. The same class that started with two-hundred students went down to twenty students! Each lecture was recorded, so these students could watch the class online. Another difference with the education system was in the amount of work given. At Bucknell, I have homework due every class. In Scotland, you only have one or two assignments for each course for the whole semester, but they are very difficult assignments. At first, I found myself with a lot of extra time, not having to worry about homework due every day, but then I realized how difficult the homework assignments were and had to spend more time on them. It still did not compare to the workload I was used to at Bucknell.</p>

                        <p>Central campus is home to the College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences and the School of Informatics. Central campus is located in Old Town, Edinburgh, about a five minute walk from my resdience building. I had two classes here, "Scotland and Heritage" and "Computer Communications and Networks".</p>

                        <p>King's Buildings is home to the College of Engineering. It is located one mile from Central campus in the urban area of Edinburgh. There was a free shuttle bus available for students and faculity from Central campus to Kings' Buildings that came every twenty minutes. You have to show up at least five minutes before the bus arrives to get a seat, if not, you are running to Kings to make class! I had "Digital Systems Design II" and "Computer Simulation" at King's Buildings.</p>

                        <p>Yes, Appleton Tower needs its own section. Appleton Tower is the Informatics student's "hub". I spent hours and hours in this builing working on homework assignments. There are eight floors in Appleton, the first two are lecture halls and classrooms. Levels 3 and 4 had a kitchen and rooms of about four people. Levels 5 and 6 were labratories. The labs were always packed at all hours! I've never been past the sixth floor, so the last two floors are a mystery! Although I was frustruated most of the time I was in Appleton Tower, it was one of the most calming places to work because of the view. Sometimes while I was working I would catch myself staring outside for too long. On one side, you could see the town of Edinburgh with mountains in the distance. The other side was my favorite, with a view of Aurthur's Seat and Nicolson Street. Appleton Tower was also right next to my favorite coffee shop, Cafe Nero... what a coincidence!</p>
