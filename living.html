              <p>Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland with a population around 500,000 people. The city has the buzz of a modern capital city in a beautiful historical setting. It is home to the Scottish Parliment located along the Royal Mile. The Royal Mile leads to the Edinburgh Castle, which is free for Arcadia students with a Historical Scotland Membership card! One of my favorite places to spend time in Edinburgh was at Holyrood Park located at the bottom of the Royal Mile. The Holyrood Palace, the official residence of Queen Elizabeth II, can be found in the park. Arthur's Seat, an extinct volcano, is at the center of the park. Arthur's Seat is a difficult, but short, half hour hike to a beautiful view of Edinurgh. From the top, you can see Portobello Beach leading to the North Sea. You can also see the main shopping street, Prince's Street. Prince's Street is lined with all my favorite stores, H&M, Urban Outfitters, TK Maxx (Yes, it's TK, not TJ!), and many more! Along Prince's Street you can walk past the Balmoral Hotel, Scott Memorial, and walk through the Prince's Street gardens! From Prince's Street, you can walk to Calton Hill that overlooks the city. Calton Hill is included in Edinburgh's UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>

              <p>During my time in Edinburgh, I stayed in a flat in Kincaid's Court. Kincaid's Court had a perfect location in the center of Prince's Street, Central Campus, Pleasance gym, and grocerry stores. We were located on Cowgate Street, known to be the crazy street just about every night! I had four roommates in my flat, each with our own rooms, and two bathrooms and a kitchen. One of my flatmates, Lexi, became one of my closest friends. Grace and Caroline were two of my other flatmates who were very nice, but we kind of did our own things. My last roommate, R-Dawg (I never learned her real name), was from China and would never talk to the rest of us. Other than some issues with R-Dawg, we had a nice flat compared to the others. Our flat became the hangout place because of our centrality with everything!</p>

              <h2 class="tm-news-title dark-gray-text">Grocerries</h2>
              <p>Grocerry shopping in the UK was a lot different than at home. One of the main differences were bags. If you didn't bring a reusable bag to the store, you had to pay for them. I barely saw anyone without their own resuable bag, so this system saves a ton of plastic. The other difference was the price of food. Depending on what stores you went to, food could be expensive, but most stores were extremely cheap compared to the United States. Stores like Tesco and Salinsbury would be on the expensive side whereas Lidl was super cheap. I would go to Lidl once a week and spend fifteen pounds maximum for grocerries! UK grocerry stores also lack snacks. The only snacks that they carry are rice cakes, potatoe chips, and candy. Some stores would have an American isle that offers Oreos, hot dogs, and gluten free pretzels. One of the hardest things to find in Scotland was regular tasting shredded cheese. There was only one store, Tesco, that carried something similar. When I went grocerry shopping I would get the majority of my food from Lidl, but would stop at other stores along the way for more American foods. Checking out at grocerry stores was the most stressful part. It was all self-checkout that moved fast, but there was always a line of people behind you! If one item wasn't registering on the scale after scanning it, an employee would have to come and check all of you items. To reward myself for the stressful task of grocerry shopping, I always bought a fresh baked soft pretzel from the bakery!</p>

              <p>Because Edinburgh is such a big school, you could never find room in the library. Most people studied in coffee shops! Helena and I would try a new coffee shop every Wednesday. We enjoyed Black Medicine, Coffee Angel, and Cafe Nero. It was definetly an adjustment to study with so many people around and lots going on, but with headphones and a pastry, it was an awesome place to spend time!<br><br>Edinburgh is full of resturants and pubs! Most of the food was similar to what you would find here, with the ocasional Scottish dishes including haggis, black pudding, and porridge. We learned very quickly that if you sit down in a resturant, you will be there for a long time waiting for the check! We tried to eat in most days, we probably ate out once a week. One of our group favorites was Civerinos, a pizza place that was inexpensive for their huge slices. I really liked Byron, where we celebrated my birthday and had the best mac n cheese!<br><br>Living on Cowgate meant that we were near most of the best pubs. We would walk down the block to Three Sisters or up to Brass Monkey to enjoy board games! Towards the end of our time, we enjoyed Revolution and Tron! One of the coolest pubs we went to was Frankenstein. Every hour, Frankenstein comes down from the ceiling for a "show". It was really neat!</p>

              <p>Everyone always said that all it did in Scotland was rain, but I thought that was untrue. In Arcadia's handbook, it stated that it rains the same amount in Rome as it does in Edinburgh! Some days, you would get all four seasons. It would be cold, then super sunny, then rain and snow, and be sunny again! The few times it snowed in Edinburgh, it never stuck around, the ground was too warm for it to stick. There was one day that it snowed a lot and started to stick to the rgorund, but it didn't last more than two hours! In January, it would be dark most of the day. The only hours of light would be from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.. By the time I left, it was light from 6:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.. The temperature was always around the same everyday at anout 45 degrees Farhenhighet.</p>

              <h2 class="tm-news-title dark-gray-text">Language Barrier</h2>
              <p>When choosing a country to study abroad, I made sure to pick a place that spoke English. When speaking with a Scottish person, their accent made it seem as if it were another language! Even though Scotland speaks English, many of their words would be different and would cause much confusion. Below is a list of words that Britians use differently.

              <p>For all of the Harry Potter fans, Edinburgh is the birthplace of the series! The author the books, J.K. Rowling lives in Edinburgh and found inspiration for many details in the book in the city. What is now the Elephant House is known to be the spot where most of her writing took place. It was also said that she wrote a decent amount in my favorite study spot, Black Medicine. Pictured to the right is Victoria Street which is said to be the inspiration for Diagon Alley, where wizards can find all of their suuplies for Hogwarts. One of the first activities we did in Edinburgh was a ghost tour. The tour took us to Greyfriars Kirkyard where you can find some of the characters' names on the gravestones. In the graveyard you can find Anne and Robert Potter, William McGonagall, Elizabeth Moodie, Charles Black, and he who must not be named, Thomas Riddell. Over the wall of the graveyard you can see George Heriot's School, her inspiration for Hogwarts. The school has the same houses and colors as in Harry Potter.<br><br></p> <p class="tab"> Scary Fact: While on the ghost tour, we were told about the tales of Bluidy MacKenzie. The story starts after King Charles II signed the National Covenant to keep Scotland a Presbyterian country. Many people refused to swear allegiance to the King and were imprisoned in a section of Greyfriars Kirkyard. The prisoners were tormented and persecuted by the hands of Lord Advocate Sir George Mackenzie. otherwise known as "Bluidy MacKenzie". Overall, Mackenzie was responsible for 18,000 deaths. When he died, he was buried in a casket contained in the Black Mausoleum tomb in Greyfriars Kirkyard. Even since his death, over 500 ghost attacks have been reported by vistors of the tomb. The tour guide is telling us this story as we stand on the steps of the tomb. He finishes the tales of Bluidy MacKenzie by warning us that Mackenzie will follow people home and scratch them. He advised as to check our bodies when we were getting ready for bed that night. Before we left he asked if anyone was brave enough to knock on Mackenzie's tomb to wake him. Of course PJ walks right up to the tomb and knocks on it, waking up Mackenzie. I went home that night and sure enough, Lena and I both had scratches on our legs. Let's just say, I had a very hard time falling alseep that night! ~True story</p></p>
